# Yoda Speak

Create a simple application that uses [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [Yoda Speak](https://market.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak) API.

Basically you should take a text from standard input or program argument. Then it should ask the Yoda-Speak API for the result and print it to the standard output.
