## Workshop

As strategy to progress, pick one from each section as you go along with the exercises.


### Strings

Strings are basic data structures, they can be treated like lists / arrays.

 -  [01](strings/simplereplace/simple-replace.js)
 -  [02](strings/reverse/reverse.js)
 -  [03](strings/urlfixer/url-fixer.js)
 -  [04](strings/takeslonger/takes-longer.js)
 -  [05](strings/todoprint/todo-print.js)
 -  [06](strings/hewillnever/he-will-never.js)


### Arrays

Let's play more with array manipulation:

 -  [01](lists/solarsystem/solar-system.js)
 -  [02](lists/matchmaking/matchmaking.js)
 -  [03](lists/appendletter/append-letter.js)
 -  [04](lists/candyshop/candyshop.js)
 -  [05](lists/elementfinder/element-finder.js)
 -  [06](lists/isinlist/is-in-list.js)
 -  [07](lists/quoteswap/quote-swap.js)
 -  [08](lists/calculator/calculator.js)


### Objects

Objects are "container" like structures for storing various kinds of data in a single structure. They are very similar to Python's dictonaries.

 -  [01](hashes/student-counter/student-counter.js)
 -  [02](hashes/student-filter/student-filter.js)
 -  [03](hashes/bank-transfer/bank-transfer.js)
 -  [04](hashes/festival-entry/festival-entry.js)
 -  [05](hashes/table-printer/table-printer.js)


## Individual Workshop Review
Please follow the styleguide: [Our JavaScript styleguide](../../styleguide/javascript.md)

- Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
- Are the includes palced on the top of the files?
- Is the indentation good in each file?
- Is there unnecessary code?
- Can you find unnecessary code in comments?
- Is there unnecessary code duplication?
- Are there unnecessary empty blocks?
- Can you spot unused variables?
- Is the commit message meaningful?
- Can iterating over lists and arrays simplifed?
- Are the names of things following the styleguide?
- Are all of the brackets in the perfect place?
- Whitespaces, where they should be, where shouldn't?
