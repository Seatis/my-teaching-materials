# Implement CharSequence
Write a class that implements the [CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/CharSequence.html) interface found in the java.lang package. Your implementation should return the string backwards. 

 Write a small main method to test your class; make sure to call all four methods.
