# Implement CharSequence
Write a class `CharOperations` that implements the [CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/CharSequence.html) interface found in the java.lang package. Your implementation should return strings.

 Write a small main method to test your class; make sure to call all four methods(including toString method).
