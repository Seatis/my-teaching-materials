# Abstracts & Interfaces
*There are times when we need common features in classes but they don't work on their own.* <br />
In some situations either:-
- we want to inherit from multiple classes
- the base classes have expectations in order to be used, or in order to support a much larger framework.  

Java gets round this through Abstracts and Interfaces.

## Material Review
- `implements`
- interface
- abstract class
- abstract methods
- polymorphism
- method overriding
- method overloading

Optional
- Diamond problem
- Comparison
  - compareTo()
  - Comparable<T>
  - Comparator<Model>

## Workshops
- [01) Instruments to Stringed Instruments](instruments/Instruments.md) - 2 levels of abstraction
- [02) Implement CharSequence](charsequence/CharSequence.md)
- [03) Reservations](reservations/Reservations.md)
- [04) Credit Card ](creditcard/Creditcard.md)
- [05) Credit Card Reservations ](credicardreservations/CreditCardReservation.md) - implements 2 interfaces
- [06) Comparable](comparator/Comparator.md) - something we'd use to compare values



## Individual Workshop Review
As always neatness counts in coding.

Please be sure you're well acquainted with the guidelines on coding: [GreenFox Academy's Java Styleguide](../../styleguide/java.md)
