# Playing around with colors

There is one interface given:
```java
package com.greenfox.colors

public interface MyColor {

    public void printColor();
}
```
Any kind of color class (for i.e. RedColor) can implement this interface overriding `printColor();` sout-ing for i.e. `"It is red in color..."`.

Your task is to create the java based configuration file as well.
