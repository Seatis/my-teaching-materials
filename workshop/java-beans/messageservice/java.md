# Switching MessageServices

Let's create another Spring project.
Letâ€™s say we want to send email message or twitter message to the users. The goal is to create an application where the way of sending message can be easily switched by moving @Bean annotation in the configuration.

You will need to have an interface, `MessageService`, with single method declaration for sending message.
Two classes that implements this interface, `EmailService` and `TwitterService`. You will need one `MessageConfiguration`, and one `MessageProceeder`class.

You will need to set up 2 package directories under com.greenfox.messageservice:
- configuration
- service

`MessageService` should be injected into `MessageProceeder` class using field-based, constructor-based and setter-based dependency injections, however only one of them should be wired.</br>
Hint: Don't forget to scan for components(beans) in the relevant package.

The Application class should be:

```java
package com.greenfox.messageservice;

import ...

@SpringBootApplication
public class MessageserviceApplication implements CommandLineRunner{

	@Autowired
	MessageProceeder messageProceeder;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(MessageserviceApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Override
	public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
		messageProceeder.processMessage("Hi Barba, How are you?", "office@greenfox.com");
	}
}
```


One of the two possible results should look like this:

SOME SPRING INFO</br>
`Email Sent to office@greenfox.com with Message=Hi Barba! How are you?`</br>
SOME SPRING INFO
