# Beans
*There are times when we need common features in classes but they don't work on their own.*

In some situations either:-
- we want to inherit from multiple classes
- the base classes have expectations in order to be used, or in order to support a much larger framework.  

Java gets round this through Abstracts and Interfaces.
