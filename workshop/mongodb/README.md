## Workshop

### Set up mongodb
- In the materials there were references how to install Mongodb on your system, so install it :)
    - Ubuntu users can apt-get `mongodb-org`: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
- Start the Mongo daemon (`mongod`)
- Test if mongo is runnable, type `mongo` in your terminal
- If so, exit and import the [test data](restaurants.json):
```
$ mongoimport --db test --collection restaurants --drop --file ~/Downloads/restaurants.json
```
- This will import the test data to the test database's restaurants collection

### Change the database behind your Todo API to Mongo
- Install mongodb node package:
```
npm install mongodb
```
- Setup connection, and modify the endpoints
```javascript
var mongodb = require('mongodb');
var MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient;

// Connection URL. This is where your mongodb server is running.
var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/my_database_name';

// Use connect method to connect to the Server
MongoClient.connect(url, function (err, db) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Unable to connect to the mongoDB server. Error:', err);
  } else {
    //HURRAY!! We are connected. :)
    console.log('Connection established to', url);

    // do some work here with the database.

    //Close connection
    db.close();
  }
});
```
