# Code review
*A short workshop for the first code review*

## Materials
Read the [HTML / CSS styleguide](../../styleguide/html-css.md).
Try to ignore the language features that you are familiar yet, and focus on
the formatting and style rules that you could follow.

## Material review
Run through on the whole stlyguide with the group

## Workshop
Discuss these concerns, and try to come up with examples.

 - Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
 - Is the doctype present and valid?
 - Is the semantic structuring good in the html file?
 - Are the color codes valid?
 - Is there unnecessary code duplication?
 - Is the indentation good in each file?
 - Are the attributes valid on each tag?
 - Are there unnecessary code or empty selectors?
 - Are the `<ul>` and `<li>` elements valid?
 - Are there id duplications?
 - The code should not show errors here: https://validator.w3.org/
 - Are the used id and class names reflecting their purposes?
 - Is the commit message meaningful?


Ask for a volunteer and review their code together, by starting with [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
