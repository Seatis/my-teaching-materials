// Create Server and Client Applications based on the sample code written by egdice
// that send and receive numeric messages. The messages should include a clientID
// a step ID and a timestemp. Or better yet; Think about this: What kind of information do You need
// to send in a message so that:
//   - Each message is definitely unique
//   - Each can be identified eg.: to which client it belongs
//   - Each tells a certain step in an amoeba game so that it's quite certain what happened :)
// Make it so, that the server application prints them to the onsole and logs then into a file.
// The file should have a name that makes it unique and ties it to a specific starting date & time.
