## Project
Palindome Kata
The Kata has two part, the first one is mandatory for everybody, the second
two are just for students, who already know programming.

### 1st Part:
Create a function that takes a string and creates a palindrome from it.
It should work like this:
```c_cpp
string output = CreatePalindrome("pear");

cout << output << endl;) // it prints: pearraep
```
### 2nd Part:
Create a function that searches for all the palindromes in a string that are
at least than 3 characters, and returns a list with the found palindromes.
Example:
```c_cpp
string output = SearchPalindromes("dog goat dad duck doodle never");

cout << output << endl; // it prints: ['og go', ' dad ', 'd d', 'dood', 'eve']
```

### 3rd Part:
Create a function that list all prime palindrome numbers between 0 and 1000000 
and stores it in an array, then prints the 3rd element of it this array in binary format.
