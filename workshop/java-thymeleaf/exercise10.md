# Exercise 10

 - Now we have a template showing all the information about our BankAccounts and their owners
 - Pimp this template a little bit to look more shiny ;)
 - Add a new coloumn where you create a `form` for each BankAccount
 - Make it possible to raise the number of Zebras with 10 if you click on this button
   (only topup that BankAccount which button was clicked)
