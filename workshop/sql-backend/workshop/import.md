# Import user data to MySQL

Use the bookstore (data.sql) database form the previously completed SQL basics workshop. 

## Examine the data

 - Look carefully at the [user data file](data/users.csv). It is provided in CSV format. 
 - Try to come up with matching MySQL field types.

## Parse the CSV

 - Read it to memory and prepare for insertion

## Design your table

 - it should be a single table

## Test your code

 - write a test function that confirms that the CSV file has the same records as the imported table

## Gotchas
 
 - Your import can (and probably will fail a few times). Come up with a strategy to easily empty the records in your table
