# Database Integration
Java Persistence API is a collection of classes and methods to persistently store the vast amounts of data into a database. Spring Data JPA focuses on using JPA to store data in a relational database. Its most compelling feature is the ability to create repository implementations automatically, at runtime, from a repository interface.
