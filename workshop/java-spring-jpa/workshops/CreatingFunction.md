# Add creating function

- Work on the same project
- Extend the project and add a create todo view and methods
- You will need two different methods(GET, POST) in controller
- The view should be a simple form, which should receive the new object and if the template is right then it should create the needed object for us
- hint: google handling form submission spring
- In your controller you only need to save the passed object with the repository, this should be the POST method
- After the user submitted the form and the Todo is saved redirect to the list page
- Add a link to the `list` page which redirects to the `add todo` page
