# Sum the Array
 - Create a generic method that `<T extends Number>` so converting to primitive number types is available
 - This method takes an array, and an integer length value
 - This method should return the sum of the arrays elements
 - Handle exceptions where your the length value is more then the bounds of the array
 - Whether or not you had an exception print out the elements of the array
