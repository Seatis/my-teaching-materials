# Single Value Annotation
 - Extend 2 class from the previously created screen class
   - class Screen43
   - class Screen169
   - class Screen219
 - Make sure the annotations are inherited also
 - Add the `String aspectratio()` value to the @interface and set it's default value to `"4:3"`
 - Correct the aspectratio value if necessary in the inherited classes(e.g. Screen169's value is `"16:9"`)
