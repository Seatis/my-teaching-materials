# Sort the Array
 - Create a generic method that `<T extends Number>` so converting to primitive number types is available
 - This method takes an array in parameter, and sort it in a descending order
 - Pro tip: Temporary values/arrays help a lot
 - Whether or not you had an exception print out the elements of the array
