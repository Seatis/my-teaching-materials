# Split String
 - Write a function that receives a string and an integer
 - The function should return an array of strings, with two string in it
 - The first string should be the first part of the original string
 - Characters in range [0,index-1].
 - The second part should be the rest of the string characters range [index,length-1]
 - Example: split("lovebarbara", 4)
 - Result: {"love", "barbara"}
 - Handle the exception if the index is out of bounds
