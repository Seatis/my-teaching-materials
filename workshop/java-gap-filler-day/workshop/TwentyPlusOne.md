# Twenty Plus One
 - Create the beloved Twenty Plus One game!
 - Create a Card, a Deck, and a Game class
 - The Card class has 3 enum properties:
   - One for the color(red, black)
   - One for the suit(clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades)
   - One for the rank(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A)
 - The Deck class holds the instances of the Card classes
 - Create methods for the class(shuffleDeck, pullFirst, pullLast, pullRandom)
 - The Game class is responsible to the game itself
 - It should have a method that generates a random number between 15 and 21, which will be the opponents score
 - It should ask the player to continue or to stop drawing cards
 - The game is lost, if the sum of the pulled cards are above 21 or below the random number
