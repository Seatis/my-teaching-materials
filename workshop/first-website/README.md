### Follow these steps

#### Keep things tidy
 - Create a folder for all your Green Fox materials. 
 - Then within that, a folder for the first week
    - within that a folder for the first day's assignment
 - Check the recommended [folder structure](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/definitions/blob/master/github-usage.md#folder-structure) and please follow it

#### Create your first page
