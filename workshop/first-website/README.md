### Steps
 - **Keep things tidy.**
   Create a folder for all your Green Fox materials. Then within that, a folder for the first week, and within that a folder for the first day's assignment.
   Check the recommended [folder structure](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/definitions/blob/master/github-usage.md#folder-structure) and please follow it.
 - **Create your first page**
   Create a html file using your editor called `index.html`, and open it in your browser.
 - **Start with the content.**
   Copy-paste the headings and the first 3 paragraphs of text from [the article above](https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp) to start with.
 - **Give it some structure.**
   What semantic role do these paragraphs fill? Divide it into a few separate HTML tags.
 - **Add a header image.**
   Download the image from the medium site, and save it next to your html file.
 - **Add in style.**
   Create a style.css file and link it to your HTML.
   How do you center content on the page?
   Try adding a custom font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Lato|Merriweather).
