# Frontend
- First create a new spring project
- Add dependencies: web, thymeleaf, devtools
- Create a MainController with a single endpoint to `/`
  - render `index.html` here
- Download the `resources` folder from here and place it under your project
- Try to run your app and check the index page!
- If you see a nice page where you can test the next exercises, proceed to the next one.
