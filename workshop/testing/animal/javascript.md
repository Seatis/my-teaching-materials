# Animal

- Create `Animal` object
  - Every animal has a `hunger` value, which is a whole number
  - Every animal has a `thirst` value, which is a whole number
  - when creating a new animal object these values are created with the default `50` value
  - Every animal can `eat()` which decreases their hunger by one
  - Every animal can `drink()` which decreases their thirst by one
  - Every animal can `play()` which increases both by one

- Create tests that covers all types of input (like in the previous workshop exercise)
