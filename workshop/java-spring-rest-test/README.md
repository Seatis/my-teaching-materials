# Testing a REST Service
For testing HTTP endpoints Spring MVC provides a great support. It provides very nice middle solution between unit-testing and integration-testing where it lets you stand up the entire Spring MVC DispatcherServlet-send request to the specific Spring MVC controller, it is including validators, HttpMessageConverters, and more - and then run tests against them without actually starting up a real HTTP service.
