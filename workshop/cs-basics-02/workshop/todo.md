# TODO APP
*Let's create our favorite Todo App with C#!*

## Part I
 - Create the logic of the Todo App
   - It will be the same as the first we made, except insted of arguments we run an infinite loop which will take the orders from the user in string format
   - The mandatory features are:
     - list todos
     - add todo
     - delete todo
     - update todo
   - Feel free to add as much custom features as you want

## Part II
 - You will need a local SQL server
 - Use Entity Framework with Databse-First or Code-First to connect to your database
 - Store your todos in your local database
 - Modify the features to manage your todos from your database
 - *(If you can use LINQ Expressions!)*
