## Workshop
A mentor will guide your through various blocks provided by the PXT tool.
There are practice tasks after each segment. 
**Please always save the JavaScript code of your solutions!**

Keep in mind that a help info
will pop up if you keep your mouse pointer on a block in the PXT tool.

### Tools
 - [micro:bit PXT tool](https://pxt.microbit.org/?lang=en)

### Steps

**Basic blocks**
  - Guide through
    - on start
    - forever
    - show number
    - show string
    - pause
    - clear screen
  - Task
    - Blink an up arrow pattern

**Led blocks**
  - Guide through
    - plot
    - unplot
    - toggle
    - point
    - set brightness
    - brightness
    - led enable
  - Task
    - Change the blinking brightness to 123

**Variables blocks**
  - Guide through
    - what is a variable
    - set
    - change
  - Task
    - At startup show 4,5,6,7 numbers after each other using a variable

**Loop blocks**
  - Guide through
    - repeat
    - while
    - for
  - Task
    - Do the previous task with a loop (much shorter solution, isn't it?)

**Logic blocks and input blocks**
  - Guide through
    - if
    - if-else
    - comparison
    - logical operations
    - events
    - sensor values
      - acceleration
      - temperature
      - rotation
      - magnetic force
  - Task
    - Draw an exclamation mark while the board is shaking and button B is pressed
    - Make a spirit level device (use pitch and roll rotation and the led display)

**Math blocks**
  - Guide through
    - math operators
    - random values
    - reminder
    - min-max
    - absolute
  - Task
    -  Make a freefall detector (use the absolute value of the z-axis
      acceleration value)

**Text blocks**
  - Guide through
    - what is a character
    - what is a string
    - length
    - join
    - char from
    - parse
    - substring
    - compare
  - Task
    - Join a string and show it on the led screen
    - Parse a string which contains a number and show it as a number on the led screen

**Radio blocks**
  - Guide through
    - set group
    - send number
    - send string
    - send value
    - receive events
  - Task
    - Send a message to someone and show it on the led screen of the receiver
      - work together with someone
      - the transmitter sends the message
      - the receiver receives the message and shows on the screen
      - use unique group numbers!
