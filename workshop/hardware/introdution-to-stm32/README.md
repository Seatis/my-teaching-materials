# Introduction to STM32
*Learn how does the STM32 Iot microcontroller works*

## Objectives
- Know how to build a program to the STM32
- Understand the architecture of the microcontroller

## Materials & Resources
### Environment
  - Make sure that System Workbench for STM32 is installed on your machine (see [IDE-Installation-Guide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/totoro-syllabus/blob/master/IDE-Installation-Guide.md) for further information)
  - Make sure that [STM32CubeL4 libary package](http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubel4.html) is installed on your machine

## Material Review
### Microcontroller
#### Abstraction
- Meaning of abstarction
    - example in a C code
- Microcontroller
    - BSP Driver
    - Low Layer (LL)
    - Core drivers
    - hardware absztaction layer (HAL)
    - Middleware components

#### Embedded software
- What is it good for
- Usage in our class
- Real time operation
