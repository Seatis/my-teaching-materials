# Introduction to STM32
*Learn how does the STM32 Iot microcontroller works*

## Objectives
- Know how to build a program to the STM32
- Understand the architecture of the microcontroller

## Materials & Resources
### Environment
  - Make sure that System Workbench for STM32 is installed on your machine (see [IDE-Installation-Guide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/totoro-syllabus/blob/master/IDE-Installation-Guide.md) for further information)
  - Make sure that [STM32CubeL4 libary package](http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubel4.html) is installed on your machine
      - In the "GET SOFTWARE" section click on the "Get Software" button to download the package
      - An ST registration will be required
      - A .zip file will be downloaded, which contains a lot's of source files
      - Unzip it to a folder
      - You can version control that folder with GIT
          - Be sure not to push all the source code to you github account
          - It is an enormous amount of code, we will deal with it properly later

## Material Review
### Microcontroller
#### Abstraction
- Meaning of abstarction
    - example from a [previous workshop](#)
- STM32CubeL4
    - Level 0
        - Low Layer (LL)
        - Core drivers
        - BSP Driver
        - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
    - Level 1
        - Middleware components
    - Level 2
        - Application

#### Embedded software
- What is it good for
- Usage in our class
- Real time operation
