# Algorithms

*The study of algorithms is interesting because it is a new field, with a rich tradition*

## Objectives

- learn how to create and code specific algorithms
- be prepared for tricky interview questions

#### Material review
- Euclid's method
- The sieve of Eratosthenes
- Data structures
    - arrays (sieve of Eratosthenes)
        - the size of the array is known
        - each element can be accesed
    - linked lists
        - nodes and links
        - head points to the first node of the list
        - changing the order of items
        - add and delete an element
    - stacks
    - queues
    -min
    -max
    -average
    -moving average

##### Exercises
##### 1
First implement Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. Don't use modulus. When you have a functional algorithm:
- check out the values that the program computes when *x* and *y* are not positive
- try to count how many statements are executed when you run the program with two positive numbers, print out or store  the values of *x* and *y*
- **Advanced task:** compute the greatest common divisor of three integers (*x, y and z*)

##### 2
Create an array and store some numbers in it:
- find the minimum value of the array
- find the maximum value of the array
- calculate the average and the moving average
