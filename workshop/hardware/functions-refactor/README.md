#### Fibonacci sequence with recursion

> What is a Fibonacci sequence? In mathematics a number is a Fibonacci number if it is equal to the sum of the two number before it. This is a sequence it's first element is 1. the second is 1. so the thrid element must be 2. Here is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence:
`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13`
> *[for more detail check [Fibonacci Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) on Wikipedia]*

We can say a number is a Fibonacci number if `Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2` and `F1 = 1` and `F2 = 1`

    - standard library functions
        - printf
        - sizeof
            - play with it with different types
            - char, short, int, long, longlong
            - uint8_t, int8_t, float, double
