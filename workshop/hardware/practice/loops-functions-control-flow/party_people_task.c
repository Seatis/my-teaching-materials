// The first number represents the number of girls that comes to a party, the
// second the boys
// It should print: The party is excellent!
// If the the number of girls and boys are equal and there are more people coming than 20

// It should print: Quite cool party!
// If there are more than 20 people coming but the girl - boy ratio is not 1-1

// It should print: Average party...
// If there are less people coming than 20
// It should print: Sausage party
// If no girls are coming, regardless the count of the people
