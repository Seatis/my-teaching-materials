//Create a function to tell You whether a certain number is part of a 10 long array of integers.
//Create an other function to give You the first index of a given integer in an array of integers. 
//Create an other functions to give You the index of the last occurrence of the given integer in 
//the array.If the array does not include the given integer this function should return -1.
//Do not duplicate functionality, use the functions You've created earlier instead of duplicating.
//Create 5 arrays, each 10 long filled with integers.
//Find the first and last occurrances of the integer: 14. And Print them out. If the array does not
//include the integr You should say so in words.
//The names of the functions should be "includes", "firstIndexOf", "lastIndexOf"
//Decide what should the function return. Void? Bool? Int? Float? Char?
