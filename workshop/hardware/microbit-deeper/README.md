#### Binary numbers
Learn how to convert binary, hexadecimal and decimal numbers into each other.

First watch theese videos:

| Material | Time |
|:---------|-----:|
| [Binary Numbers and Base Systems as Fast as Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpuPe81bc2w) | 5:19 |
| [How To Convert Binary To Decimal Tutorial (The Easy Way)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfKe8PPI2zs) | 4:33 |
| [How To Easily Convert Hexadecimal To Binary And To Decimal Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_kA5KQxByc) | 5:40 |

Now practice the conversion algorithms! You can use [this tool](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/topics/numberConversions/). The videos don't talk about the octal (base 8) numeral system which is not widely used, so just ignore those tasks. Or you can figure it out on your own :).
