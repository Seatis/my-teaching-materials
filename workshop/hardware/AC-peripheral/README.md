## Workshop
### Analog Comparator
#### Setting up the hardware
Make the following connection between the IC and the ATmega168PB Xplained board

| TC74 pin | Pin function | Connect to ATmega168PB pin|
|-|-|-|
|1|NC|NC|
|2|SDA|SDA (PC4)|
|3|GND|GND (0V)|
|4|SCLK|SCL (PC5)|
|5|VDD| VCC |

Also:
 - don't forget the pull up resistors (external or internal)

#### Writing driver software
You are going to write I2C external device handler software. It is useful
to put all the hardware specific code in a separate .c and .h file, so it can be
reused in another project just by copying those files.

Steps:
- create a new AtmelStudio project
- copy the [following files](workshop/AtmelStudio/TC74_DRIVER) to the project folder (next to the automatically generated main.c file)
- overwrite the files if asked
- add the files to the project
- write the code where asked (marked with "TODO")
    - always test the code after you wrote a few lines of code
    - write the needed functions in the following order
        - `TWI_start(void)`
        - `TWI_write(uint8_t u8data)`
        - `TWI_stop(void)`
        - `TWI_read_nack(void)`
        - `TWI_read_ack(void)`
        - `TWI_init()`
        - `read_temp(uint8_t u8data)`
- test the driver with the external ic

## Individual Workshop Review
Please follow the styleguide: [Our C styleguide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/styleguide/c.md)

 - Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
 - Are the includes placed on the top of the files?
 - Is the indentation good in each file?
 - Is there unnecessary code?
 - Can you find unnecessary code in comments?
 - Is there unnecessary code duplication?
 - Are there unnecessary empty blocks?
 - Can you spot unused variables?
 - Is the commit message meaningful?
