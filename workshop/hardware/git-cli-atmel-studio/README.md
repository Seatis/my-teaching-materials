### Environment
  - Software needed during this week
    - Make sure that Code::Blocks is installed on your machine
    - Install Atmel Studio on your machine
        - Complete installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/totoro-syllabus/blob/master/IDE-Installation-Guide.md).

### Training
See the [workshop page](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/tree/master/workshop/command-line) for more!

#### Electronics
Watch these videos on electronic signals:

| Material | Duration |
|:---------|-----:|
| [What is AC and DC?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN9aR2wKv0U) | 4:22 |
| [Difference between Analog and Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxJKXGugfh8) | 4:01 |
| [Analogue and Digital Signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu6L4kQF3k) | 2:53 |

Also read this article
about the differences between analog and digital signals.
The "Analog and Digital Circuits" section is not needed.

| Material | Duration |
|:---------|-----:|
| [Analog vs. Digital](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital) | - |

Watch these videos on basic digital components:

| Material | Duration |
|:---------|-----:|
| [Boolean Logic & Logic Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI-qXk7XojA) | 4:01 |
| [Logic Gates from Transistors: Transistors and Boolean Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2Bwc17_wA) | 13:59 |
| [Summary of logic gates and their truth tables](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Projects/CAL/digital-logic/gatesfunc/) | - |

These gates can be used to do lot's of stuff, every digital circuit is based on
logic gates. We are going to use a microcontroller during the next workshop, so
let's take a closer look at it's architecture.

These videos will help you to understand the basic components. You don't have to
understand every little bit of information, just try to understand the concept of
 ALU, RAM, registers. Magic word: Abstraction!

| Material | Duration |
|:---------|-----:|
| [How Computers Calculate - the ALU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I5ZMmrOfnA) | 11:09 |
| [Registers and RAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpnE6UAfbtU) | 12:16 |
| [The Central Processing Unit (CPU)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZGugFqdr60) | 11:37 |

I know, I know. It was a bit hard to understand, but you can find these components
in our microcontroller.
[Here](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42176-ATmega48PB-88PB-168PB_Datasheet.pdf)
you can find it's datasheet. (The datasheet is a document
which contains information of the usage and parameters of an electric component.)

Take a look at page 13. Can you recognize the previously learned components?

The datasheet has 461 pages, it's a lot. Don't start to read it, we will get
into it later this week.

#### Command-line and GIT
