## Summary
 - [Objectives](#objectives)
 - [Materials & Resources](#materials-&-resources)
 - [Material Review](#material-review)
 - [Workshop](#workshop)

## Objectives
  - Know what kind of main components has a microcontroller
  - Learn how these components work
  - Get familiar with the command-line and GIT

## Materials & Resources
This workshop will be about git and cli, but we also learn more about
electronics.

### Environment
 - Make sure that Code::Blocks is installed on your machine
 - Install Atmel Studio on your machine

Complete installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/totoro-syllabus/blob/master/IDE-Installation-Guide.md).

### Training
#### Electronics
TODO: analog vs digital signals, digital basic elements (gates)
also the used MCU architecture

Watch these videos on electronic signals:

| Material | Time |
|:---------|-----:|
| [What is AC and DC?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN9aR2wKv0U) | 4:22 |
| [Difference between Analog and Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxJKXGugfh8) | 4:01 |
| [Analogue and Digital Signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu6L4kQF3k) | 2:53 |

Also read [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital) article
about the differences between analog and digital signals.
The "Analog and Digital Circuits" section is not needed.

Watch these videos on basic digital components:

| Material | Time |
|:---------|-----:|
| [Boolean Logic & Logic Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI-qXk7XojA&t=189s) | 4:01 |
| [Logic Gates from Transistors: Transistors and Boolean Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2Bwc17_wA) | 13:59 |

Here is a [good summary of logic gates and their truth tables](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Projects/CAL/digital-logic/gatesfunc/).

These gates can be used to do lot's of stuff, every digital circuit is based on
logic gates. We are going to use a microcontroller during the next workshop, so
let's take a closer look at it's architecture.

These videos will help you to understand the basic components. You don't have to
understand every little bit of information, just try to understand the concept of
 ALU, RAM, registers. Magic word: Abstraction!

I know, I know. It was a bit hard to understand, but you can find these components
in our microcontroller.
[Here](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42176-ATmega48PB-88PB-168PB_Datasheet.pdf)
you can find it's datasheet. The datasheet is a document
which contains information of the usage and parameters of an electric component.

Take a look at page 13. Can you recognize the previously learned components?

The datasheet has 461 pages, it's a lot. Don't start to read it, we will get into it later.
