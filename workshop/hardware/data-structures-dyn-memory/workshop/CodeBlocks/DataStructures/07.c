// A pointer that points to the end of the dynamically allocated array of ints (could be null) (tail pointer)
// A pointer that points to the currently readable buffer item (could be null) (read pointer))
// A pointer that points to the currently writable buffer item (could be null) (write pointer)
// The lenght of the buffer

// TODO:
// Create a function that returns a dynamically allocated CircularBuffer (the buffer itself should be allocated as well, not just the array inside)
// It should take a normal array and it's length as argument, and it should fill all the buffer values from the array

// TODO:
// Create a function that resizes a CircularBuffer, it should take a CircularBuffer as a pointer and change that buffers length and reallocate it's array as well. (copying it's values)

// TODO:
// Create a function that takes a CircularBuffer and returns a new CircularBuffer that only contains the even numbers from the old CircularBuffer

// TODO:
// Try all the functions in the main function, plase deallocate any buffer and the array inside it after using them
