# Sharpie
- Create `Sharpie` class
  - We should know about each sharpie their `color` (which should be a string), `width` (which will be a floating point number), `ink_amount` (another floating point number)
  - When creating one, we need to specify the `color` and the `width`
  - Every sharpie is created with a default 100 as `ink_amount`
  - We can `use()` the sharpie objects
    - which decreases inkAmount
