# Sharpie
- Create `Sharpie` class
  - We should know about each sharpie their `Color` (which should be a string), `Width` (which will be a floating point number), `InkAmount` (another floating point number)
  - When creating one, we need to specify the `Color` and the `Width`
  - Every sharpie is created with a default 100 as `InkAmount`
  - We can `Use()` the sharpie objects
    - which decreases inkAmount
