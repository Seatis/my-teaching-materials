# Counter
- Create `Counter` class
  - which has an integer property
  - when creating it should have a default value 0 or we can specify it when creating
  - we can `Add(number)` to this counter another whole number
  - or we can `Add()` without parameters just increasing the counter's value by one
  - and we can `Get()` the current value as string
  - also we can `Reset()` the value to the initial value
