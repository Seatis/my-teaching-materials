// Write a function that can throw two kinds of exceptions: int and const char*
// It should receive an integer.
// It should return a string from the char* array defined below.
// If the integer is larger than 5, throw an integer exception. The value of the exception should be how much larger it is.
// If the integer is less than 0, it should throw a const char* exception stating, that it is a negative number.
//
// Illustrate both cases in the main function.
// HINT: Put each protected code segmetn in a new try-catch block.
