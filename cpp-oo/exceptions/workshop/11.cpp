// Duplicate the Stack class from the previous exercies.
// Create a _base_class_ for Your exception.
// The class should have a private field:
// 1.) A field of type: in So You can give back the element which caused the problems.
// Set all the fields in the constructor only of the base class only..
// Create a get... method for this field. Again, in the base class only. This should not be virtual.
// Create a _virtual_ std::string toString() method, which is abstract (=0).
// Create a subclass for each possible exception type that might occur.
// 
// - Demonstrate how this works in the main function. Print the error messages from the main function.
// - Don't forget to declare for each method what kind of exception they might be throwing.
// - You can order the consecutive catch blocks one after an other in more ways. Try them out.
// - Try out with the base class in the catch first.
// - Try out with the inherited classes in the first catch block.
// - Print out at the end of the main function in plain text, what You've learned about the importane of the order of the catch blocks.
// - Print out also what You've learned here about polymorphism.
