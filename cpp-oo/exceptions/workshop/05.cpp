#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Write a function that receives a string and a character.
// The function should return an array of strings.
// The function should split the string at the character it receives as the second argument.
// The character it uses to split should not be in any of the new strings.
// Example: split("What a nice day", ' ');
// Result: {"What", "a", "nice",  "day"}
// If the index is out of bounds, throw an exception.
// If the character is not in the string throw a different exception.
//
// In the main function demonstrate the function when working, and when throwing an exception. 
// Write the results to the console.
