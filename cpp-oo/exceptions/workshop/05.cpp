#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Write a function that receives a string and a character.
// The function should return an array of strings. Or a vector of strings, or a struct that 
// has a string array as a field and an int representing the size of the string array. Or a
// class to the same effect, or anything else that get's the job done. Up to You.
// I suggest vector<string>.
// The function should split the string at the character it receives as the second argument.
// The character it uses to split should not be in any of the new strings.
// Example: split("What a nice day", ' ');
// Result: {"What", "a", "nice",  "day"}
// If the character is not in the string throw an exception.
//
// In the main function demonstrate the function when working, and when throwing an exception. 
// Write the results to the console.
