## Workshop

As strategy to progress, pick one from each section as you go along with the exercises.

### Strings

Strings are basic data structures, they can be treated like lists / arrays.

 -  [01](strings/simplereplace/simplereplace.py)
 -  [02](strings/reverse/reverse.py)
 -  [03](strings/urlfixer/urlfixer.py)
 -  [04](strings/takeslonger/takeslonger.py)
 -  [05](strings/todoprint/todoprint.py)
 -  [06](strings/newliner/newliner.py)


### Lists

Let's play more with list manipulation

 -  [01](lists/solarsystem/solarsystem.py)
 -  [02](lists/matchmaking/matchmaking.py)
 -  [03](lists/appendletter/appendletter.py)
 -  [04](lists/candyshop/candyshop.py)
 -  [05](lists/elementfinder/elementfinder.py)
 -  [06](lists/isinlist/isinlist.py)
 -  [07](lists/quoteswap/quoteswap.py)
 -  [08](lists/calculator/calculator.py)


### Dictinaries

Dictonaries are "dumb" structures for storing various kinds of data in a single structure. 

 -  [01](hashes/student-counter/student-counter.py)
 -  [02](hashes/student-filter/student-filter.py)
 -  [03](hashes/bank-transfer/bank-transfer.py)
 -  [04](hashes/festival-entry/festival-entry.py)
 -  [05](hashes/table-printer/table-printer.py)



## Individual Workshop Review
Please follow the styleguide: [Our Python styleguide](../../styleguide/python.md)

- Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
- Are the includes palced on the top of the files?
- Is the indentation good in each file?
- Is there unnecessary code?
- Can you find unnecessary code in comments?
- Is there unnecessary code duplication?
- Are there unnecessary empty blocks?
- Can you spot unused variables?
- Is the commit message meaningful?
- Can iterating over lists and arrays simplifed? 
- Are the names of things following the styleguide?
- Are all of the brackets in the perfect place?
- Whitespaces, where they should be, where shouldn't?
