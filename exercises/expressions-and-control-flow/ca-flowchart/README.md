# Expression and Control flow
*Cognitive apprenticeship material ideas*

## Objectives
- Show them that already exciting thing could be built with the skillset they have learnt in the first day
- Show them how we make a flowchart to demonstrate the logic of our thinking
- Show them how we resolve errors and how we use the debug tool for investigation
- Show them how we style our code and name variables
- By thinking out loud show them how we start to solve a problem, how we design the solution, how we break the task to smaller pieces
- It's NOT a goal for them to have a full understanding on all the logic we use, they won't be able to reproduce the same by their own right now. BUT they should start to get familiar with "developer thinking"


## Materials
I used the following materials in this exercise:
- variables
- types
- conditional statements
- loops
- input from console
- output to console


## Live coding suggestions
### Before coding:
- Tell them the objectives
- Ask them to focus on the best practices, the ideas, the ways of thinking and NOT to understand the actual working of everything (it's not expected for them to be able to reproduce this right now)
- Ask them to keep attention, don't ask questions during the session, write notes about the things they learnt, noticed, we'll discuss these together after the live coding
- Tell them not to try writing the code simultaneously, the code will be available on github if they'd like to analyze it later
### While coding:
- Don't explain too much, because you'll run out of time. Just think out loud and write the code.
### After coding
- Tell them that this was not the "best" way to code this, there are better implementation solutions to get the same result, we'll learn about them later

## Examples
*Select one or two based on how fast you are!*

 - Draw a simple flowchart to demonstrate your thinking (you can skip this part, but its a good way to show what these ifs and fors are doing and why)
 - Select your task and start doing it based on your flowchart (if you made one)
 - Try to use as less arrays and functions as you can, it will scare them!
