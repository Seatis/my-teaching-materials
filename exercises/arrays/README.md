- Print the fourth element

## 05
- Create an array variable named `t` with the following content: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Increment the third element
- Print the third element

## 06
- Create an array variable named `af` with the following content: `[4, 5, 6, 7]`
- Print all the elements of `af`

## 07
- Create (dynamically) a two dimensional array with the following matrix. Use a loop!
```
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
```
- Print this two dimensional array to the output

## 08
- Create an array variable named `ag` with the following content: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
- Double all the values in the array

## 09
- Create a two dimensional array which can contain the different shades of specified colors
- In `colors[0]` store the shades of green: `"lime", "forest green", "olive", "pale green", "spring green"`
- In `colors[1]` store the shades of red: `"orange red", "red", "tomato"`
- In `colors[2]` store the shades of pink: `"orchid", "violet", "pink", "hot pink"`

## 10
- Create an array variable named `ah` with the following content: `["kuty", "macs", "cic"]`
- Add all elements an `"a"` at the end

## 11
- Create an array variable named `abc` with the following content: `["first", "second", "third"]`
- Swap the first and the third element of `abc`

## 12
- Create an array variable named `ai` with the following content: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
- Print the sum of the elements in `ai`

## 13
- Create an array variable named `aj` with the following content: `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
- Reverse the order of the elements in `aj`
- Print the elements of the reversed `aj`

## 14
- Create an integer variable named `ak` and assign the value `123` to it
- Create a function called `doubling` that doubles it's input parameter
- Print the result of `doubling(ak)`

## 15
- Create a string variable named `al` and assign the value `Greenfox` to it
- Create a function called `greet` that greets it's input parameter
    - Greeting is printing e.g. `Greetings dear, Greenfox`
- Greet `al`

## 16
- Create a string variable named `am` and assign the value `kuty` to it
- Write a function called `appendA` that gets a string as an input and appends an 'a' character to its end
- Print the result of `appendA(am)`

## 17
- Write a function called `sum` that sum all the numbers until the given parameter

## 18
- Create a function called `factorio` that returns it's input factorial

## 19
- Create a recursive function called `refactorio` that returns it's input factorial

## 20
- Create a function called `printer` which prints the input String parameters (can have multiple number of arguments)
