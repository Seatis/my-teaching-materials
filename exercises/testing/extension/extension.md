# Extension
Check out the [Extend](./extend) folder. There's a work file and a test file.
- Run the tests, all 10 should be green (passing).
- The implementations though are not quite good.
- Create tests that'll fail, and will show how the implementations are wrong
- After creating the tests, fix the implementations
- Check again, if you can create failing tests
- Implement if needed
