/**
 * Create a function called "range" that creates a new array and returns a pointer to it.
 * It should fill the array with numbers based on it's paramters.
 * It should take 3 paramters:
 * int from: the first number in the array
 * int to: it will fill the array till it would reach this number (so this number is not in the array)
 * int step: the step between the numbers
 *
 * Examples:
 * range(0, 10, 2) -> {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
 * range(1, -8, -3) -> {1, -2, -5}
 *
 * It should delete any dynamically allocated resource before the program exits.
