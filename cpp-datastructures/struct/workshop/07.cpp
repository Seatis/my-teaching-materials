// It should take a normal array and it's length as argument, and it should fill all the buffer values from the array

// Create a function that resizes an IntBuffer, it should take an IntBuffer as reference and change that buffers length and reallocate it's array as well. (copying it's values)

// Create a function that takes an IntBuffer and returns a new IntBuffer that only contains the the even numbers from the old intBuffer

// Try all the functions in the main function, plase deallocate any buffer and the array inside it after using them
