# Greenfox Academy Syllabus Templates
These are templates for making our daily lives easier. You can use these templates as a base of a class' syllabus. When creating a syllabus extend the template with the actual schedule of the days, correct the order within any week and add specific dates.

## Foundation
The foundation phase should be the same regardless the technologies. The workshops are in the same order for every technology, the links differ, since the materials, the examples and the exercise boilerplates differ.
- [Language independently](foundation/README.md)
- [Python](foundation/python.md)
- [Java](foundation/java.md)
- [C#](foundation/cs.md)

## Orientation
The orientation phase can totally differ. The main focus is to orient towards a useful backend/frontend framework in the class' main language. What could need different preparatory materials and workshops.
- [Javascript, Node, Express](orientation/js-node.md)
- [Java Spring](orientation/java-spring.md)
- [C# ?](orientation/#)
