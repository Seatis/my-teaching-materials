# Greenfox Academy Syllabus Templates
These are templates for making our daily lives easier. You can use these templates as a base of a class' syllabus.

*When creating a syllabus*
  - extend the template with the actual schedule of the days
  - correct the order within any week (as the trainings, dojos schedule can be changed)
  - add specific dates
  - where there is a language specific `md` extend the link of the day

#### Fewer weekdays than 5
  - ...[1] should be on the week if there are `4` weekdays
  - ...[2] should be on the week if there are `3` weekdays
  - ...[3] should be on the week if there are `2` weekdays
  - ...[4] should be on the next week if there are `4` weekdays
  - ...[5] should be on the next week if there are `3` weekdays
  - ...[6] should be on the next week if there are `2` weekdays
  - if there's no footnote, the day can be skipped

## Foundation
The foundation phase should be the same regardless the technologies. The workshops are in the same order for every technology, the links can differ, since the materials, the examples and the exercise boilerplates differ.
 -  [Language independent](foundation/README.md)

## Orientation
The orientation phase can totally differ. The main focus is to orient towards a useful backend/frontend framework in the class' main language. What could need different preparatory materials and workshops.
 -  [Javascript, Node, Express](orientation/js-node.md)
 -  [Java Spring](orientation/java-spring.md)
 -  [C# ?](orientation/#)
