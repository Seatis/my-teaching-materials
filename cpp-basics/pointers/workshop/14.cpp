// This exercise is about implementing a game of Tic Tac Toe. You'll have to create a few functions operating on a matrix.
// (Array of arrays). The array will contain 0s where the playfield is empty. 1s where player 1 has placed an X, -1s where 
// player 2 has placed an O. An example would look like this:
// {{1,0,0}, {0,0,0}, {0,0,-1}} After the first two steps. 
// The program should be able to print out the playfield. A function doing this would get a pointer to the array representing 
// the playfield. The result should look like this for the above example:
//
// X |  | 
// -------- 
//   |  | 
// --------
//   |  | O
//
// There should be a function that checks whether a field is empty.
// There should be a function that places a step for a player. This should employ the previous function to check whether this step is available.
// Please find a way to maintain the history for each game. The history needs to contain the coordinates where the player put their mark and the
// players ID (whether it's player one or two.)
// The functions placing the steps should add the step to the history when they have made it.
//
