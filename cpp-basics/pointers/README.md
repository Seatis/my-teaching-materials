## Individual Workshop Review
Please follow the styleguide: [Our C++ styleguide](../../styleguide/cpp.md)

 - Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
 - Are the includes palced on the top of the files?
 - Is the indentation good in each file?
 - Is there unnecessary code?
 - Can you find unnecessary code in comments?
 - Is there unnecessary code duplication?
 - Are there unnecessary empty blocks?
 - Can you spot unused variables?
 - Is the commit message meaningful?
