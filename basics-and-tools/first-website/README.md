### Purpose of this workshop
Get a feel of basic HTML and CSS while recreating a simple and nice medium-length article design.
Focus on text styling, basic layout and header image.

### Steps
 - __Plan your work.__
   Determine the requirements.  Gather content, images.  Run through the basic HTML structure and make note of how it has been styled.
 - __Keep things tidy.__ 
   Create a folder for all your Greenfox materials.  Then within that, a folder for the first week, and within that a folder for the first day's assignment.
 - __Start with the content.__ 
   Create an index.html file. What are the mandatory tags in an HTML document? See [step1 in the project folder](project/step1)  .
   __Add more content.__ 
   Copy-paste a few paragraphs of text from [the article above](https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp) to start with.
 - __Give it some structure.  __
   What semantic role do these paragraphs fill? Divide it into a few separate HTML tags.
 - __ Add in style.  __
   Create a style.css file and link it to your HTML.  
   How do you center content on the page?  
   Try adding a custom font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Merriweather).  
 - __Add a header image.  __
   Try adding an image tag. How do you make it full page wide?  
   Try adding the image as background-image instead.
