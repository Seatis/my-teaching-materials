## Workshop
__Build a simple medium article.__
https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp

Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xzn3PqVKyysVTnL48t3FmDc9-NapYVzMBxz5c_HR_5o/edit#slide=id.p

### Tools
 - Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/
 - MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

### Steps
 - __Plan your work.__
   Determine the requirements.  Gather content, images.  Run through the basic HTML structure and make note of how it has been styled.
 - __Keep things tidy.__
   Create a folder for all your Green Fox materials.  Then within that, a folder for the first week, and within that a folder for the first day's assignment.
 - __Start with the content.__
   Create an index.html file. What are the mandatory tags in an HTML document? See [step1 in the workshop folder](workshop/step1).
 - __Add more content.__
   Copy-paste a few paragraphs of text from [the article above](https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp) to start with.
 - __Give it some structure.__
   What semantic role do these paragraphs fill? Divide it into a few separate HTML tags.
 - __Add in style.__
   Create a style.css file and link it to your HTML.  
   How do you center content on the page?  
   Try adding a custom font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Merriweather).  
 - __Add a header image.__
   Try adding an image tag. How do you make it full page wide?  
   Try adding the image as background-image instead.

## Individual Workshop Review
