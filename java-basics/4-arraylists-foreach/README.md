# Module 03: Day 3 - ArrayList (LinkedLists),  Iterators and Foreach
Working with lists is core to computing; the first computers were little more than engines for sorting tables.  In this day we look further into storing and working with lists.

As this is a short week, we are not doing any demos.  However, we are assigning some videos and a review for over the weekend to reinforce the various items that were learnt so far in this module.

## Assignment Review
- ArrayLists
- means to *add* and *remove*
- addAll
- contains
- containsAll *comparing one Array with another*
- clear
- isEmpty
- Iterator
- supports ArrayList
- hasNext
- associated with an ArrayList
- List
- List&lt;String&gt;
- add
- foreach()
- size (not length)

## Workshop

### ArrayLists with types

### ArraysLists & Collections
- initialise
  - empty
  - with values
  - using a loop
- add (to the next position, at an index)
- remove (by index, by value)
- set
- size()
- isEmpty
- searching: contains(), containsAll()
- assigning between arrays (*copying* toArray(), addAll())
- casting as string toString()
- difference between arrays & collection (*primitive* data types)


### Iterator
- next
- hasNext
- remove

### Foreach
- for (&lt;datatype&gt; &lt;variable&gt; : &lt;array/collection&gt;)


### Optional
#### HashSet &amp; HashMaps
- concepts: hash function, collision, order of magnitude rating
- add &amp; put
- keyset
- remove


### LinkedLists
- concept: pointing to the next, previous, first, last
- add(), addFirst(), addLast
- set()
- remove()
- size
- get(), getFirst(), getLast()
- peek()
- poll(), pollFirst(), pollLast()
- clear()

#### Other well-known types of lists
It's worth knowing conceptually what these are as they come up in interviews and are instrumental in various types of processes like email servers, windows engines, etc.
- Dictionary - ordered pairs
- Queue
  - push
  - pop
- Stack  


## Workshop/Practice

### Challenge - Kata Descending Order
- https://www.codewars.com/kata/descending-order/train/java

## Demo
- Generate palindromes for a given set of input; be able to search and match.
- Show understanding of variables, conditionals, loops and the other basic elements of a programming language.
