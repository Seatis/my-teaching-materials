It should support the following operations: +, -, *, /, % and it should support two operands. The format of the expressions must be: {operation} {operand} {operand}. Examples: "+ 3 3" (the result will be 6) or "* 4 4" (the result will be 16)

    // Start the program
    // It prints: "Please type in the expression:"
    // Waits for the user input
    // Print the result to the prompt
    // Exit
