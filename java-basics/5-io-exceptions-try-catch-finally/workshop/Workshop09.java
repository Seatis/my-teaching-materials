/**************************************************************************************************
 * Workshop: Practice Exceptions: I have to have it my way.  When an exception occurs, I want a
 * special error message, namely "7's are cannibals!" printed.
 *
 * 
 * So, I'm looking for the following output:
 * try - first statement
 * start - myMethod
 * An Exception Occurred
 * 7's are cannibals
 * Finally I did this instead
 * ::::FINISH LINE:::: out of the try/catch/finally statement
 *
 * Refer to Workshop07
 **************************************************************************************************/
import java.util.*;

public class Workshop09{

   static void myMethod(int inNumber) throws Exception// something should appear here before (see Workshop07)

   public static void main(String  args[]) // see Workshop07
   
}
