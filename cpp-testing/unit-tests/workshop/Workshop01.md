# Your first test
- Create a class, with one method (eg. `string getApple()`) that returns a string (eg. `"apple"`)
- Create a test for that.
    - Ad the Catch test framework to your project
    - Create a test case
    - Instantiate an Object from your class in the case
    - Use the `REQUIRE()`
    - Check if the return value is the same string (eg. `"apple"`)
- Compile and / Run the test
- Change the expected value to make the test failing
- Run the test
- Fix the returned value to make the test succeeding again
