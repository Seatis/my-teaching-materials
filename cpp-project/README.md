### Gomoku
#### Requirements
Create an implementation of the Gomoku game.
It should be a multiplayer game played on one computer, by changing the player in each turn.

 - The board should have 19x19 cell board.
 - The game should start with an empty board.
 - It should show a grid of cells.
 - When any of cell is clicked it should place a "stone" there.
 - After a "stone" is placed it should change the color
 - It should have an identifier next to the board that indicates which stone is next.
 - If in any row, column or diagonal has 5 in a line, it should indicate that one of the player won.

#### Technical tasks
The game should be written by using SDL (you can use both versions of SDL).
Try to write the whole application from an empty project, and use the documentation of the SDL library.
You can use any asset or drawing method, it is up to you how your application looks like.
Try to separate the concerns that is involving the use of SDL and any other game logic.
Try to write unit tests for the game logic that is not directly using the SDL library.
Plan your work, and create tasks in Trello.
