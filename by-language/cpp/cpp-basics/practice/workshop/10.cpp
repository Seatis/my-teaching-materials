//  - Is the number greater than 5? [y/n]
//  - Is the number smaller than 4? [y/n]
// (don't have to ask both kind)
//
// It should wait for input after the question
//
// If the answer is not "y" or "n" it should re-ask the question;
//
// If the program knows enough it should tell the picked number like:
// Your number is: 8
