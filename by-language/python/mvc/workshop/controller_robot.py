# Create a robot controller class. This is the mind of the robot.
# It should take an user input by listening to user input:
# Default functionaly when the robot is switched on:
#  - Automatically names the robot
#  - Sets it's position
# 
# List of commands:
#  1) memorize: add a new memory entry to the memory 
#  2) recall: displays a list memories
#  3) move: increments the robot's position by one coordinate the N-S-E-W directions
#     - it also displays the new position
#  4) speak: it can introduce itself by saying its name and mood and last memory
#
# Create the class with MVC pattern in mind. It should get and store data in the model object
# and it should pass the data to the view objects
