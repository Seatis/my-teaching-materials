### User stories
- As it is an image gallery, it should look nice, the design should be very similar to the example above.  
- Main block: It should show the currently picked picture. There should be a half-transparent box with title and description under it, but in the main block.
- At first, the first picture in the list should appear in the main block, and the related thumbnail should be signed somehow (border/shadows etc.).
- On the sides of the main block there sould be two arrow buttons. Clicking them chould change the current pic and its description to the next/previous. At the same time, the current thumbnail's outline/box-shadow should change.
- If your current photo is the last in the list: by clicking the next arrow, the main block shows the first picture.
- It should be the same with the first picture of the list and the previous arrow button.
- By picking a thumbnail the user choose the photo of the main container.
- The thumbnails' active state, and the current showed picture, should behave syncronized with the arrow buttons.

**Extras**:
- If you hover any of the thumbnails the cursor should be a pointer.
- If you hover any of the thumbnail, a pop-up should appear whith the title of the picture.
- There could be 2 arrow buttons even for the thumbnail list, so that the thumbnail list could behave like a slider.
- The gallery can be controlled by the arrow keys.


### Features (must have)
- valid html, css, js
- page has title
- nice header
- show main/first image
- main arrows swipe the main image (previous and next)
- Image title shown
- follow the design as close as you can
- clicking on thumbnail loads the image to the main container

### Nice to have (not necessarily in this order)
- background gradient
- fonts
- CSS / JS animations
- list of thumbnails for all the images
- only a few thumbnails showing, can move left and right with the arrows on the list

## How to do dis?

### Plan ALL the things!
- Imagine what you have to do
- Create sketch-up(s)
- Design your code, what will be where
- Plan your functions and variables

### Create your own stories
- Not necessarily in gitub projects, but its a nice thing to do
- Break down the functions to simple ones, like:
    - Show the main image
    - Replace the main image with js
    - ...
