# Debugging and understanding errors

## Workshop
- Download the project
- Open it in your IDE
- hint: this project won't work.
- Browse the files, try to understand what should happen
    - if you see something that you know won't work, don't solve it, just smile or kuncog
- `do`
  - Try to run `gradlew bootRun`
  - Check the errors
  - Find out together what's wrong currently, what the error says
  - Solve it!
- `while(errors)`
- finally, your application starts up, great!
- Check the site, and the functionality:
    - at the `/app` endpoint there should be displayed a form and the existing 3 users
    - when submitting the form, the submitted user should be saved in the database and this page should be shown with the new user
- `while(missingFunctionality || errors)`
    - Check the errors (on the frontend and in the log as well)
    - Find out together what's wrong currently, what the error says
    - Solve it!
- Great! Now you solved a bunch of errors, this will happen in the future many times. Remember these steps.
