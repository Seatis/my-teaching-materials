/**
 * File I/O: The copy command exercise
 * 
 * This is just standard I/O and it's usually given as an early IT assignment.  
 * 
 * Given all that you've already seen and done, this should be fairly easy.
 *
 * This is how it should work, but NOTE ...
 * >>> means that what the computer does; and 
 * <<< is what you the user does.
 *
 * >>> Enter the Source filename (assuming reading from C:\TEMP\) or give a different path name to?  
 * <<< TestA.txt
 * >>> File does not exist, try again or blank to exit
 * <<< Test.txt
 * >>> Enter the Target filename (assuming writing to C:\TEMP\) or give a different path name?  
 * <<< NewTest.txt
 * >>> Writing from C:\TEMP\Test.txt to C:\TEMP\NewTest.txt.  Press Y to confirm, N to abort.
 * <<< Y
 * >>> Done, wrote 102 Characters to C:\TEMP\NewTest.txt.
 *
 * Note that you should compute the working directory (e.g. C:\TEMP\).
