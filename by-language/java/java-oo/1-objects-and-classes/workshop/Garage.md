# The Garage
*A place for the Cars*

- Create a `Garage` class.
- The `Garage` stores `Car` instances in a list.
- When a garage is created it comes with 5 randomly created cars in it.
- You can always add random cars later (hint: `garage.addRandomCar()`)
- And you can always add specific cars (hint: `garage.addCar(car)`)
