Create a class called `Human`.  Note that this was illustrated in JCodes.04.  In this text file, however, you can see how we "talk" about the class.

+ Attributes
  - can be hungry
  - can have one or more coin
  - has a name
  - has an age
+ Constructor
  - Does not take a parameter.  When called, the human starts off:-
    - being hungry, 
    - has 100 coin(s in his/her pocket).
    - is born at 18
    - is nameless
+ Methods
  - `eat` - turns off the hunger, but costs a coin
  - `liveABit` - makes the human hungry again
