Use our `Car` in an ArrayList.

Now we're getting somewhere.

The stuff we're doing at the moment with myCar, myCar1, etc. is long-winded.  Let's put this stuff in an ArrayList.

Create the following using Random and ArrayList:-

Create Workshop01Array.java (with its own main() for testing).

pseudo-code
```
  Create a list of:
    colors {white, blue, red, silver, black, green, banana}
    makes {toyota, mazda, bmw, vw, opel, suzuki, ford, mercedes}
    engine sizes {1100, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2500}

  Create an arraylist to hold 10 cars.

  Loop 40 times:
    insert into each arraylist (lsCars) randomly generated cars;

  For the first 2 cars, printout their details.
  Drive them a little bit.

  For(Car thisCar : lsCars), printout(thisCar.toString()).
```
