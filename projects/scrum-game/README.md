### Workshop: Plan your work
#### 1. Go through the language specific notes first
- [Java focus](java.md)
- [Python focus](python.md)

#### 2. Go through the [project specification](specification.md).
#### 3. Create a Github project under your usual repository for your work and add the [project stories](stories.md).
#### 4. Form groups and plan your application together.
Plan your architecture. In your architecture you should consider the following components:

Now that you see the big picture, **go through the stories together** and think about how to break them down into tasks:
  - To classes
  - To methods
  - To data and actions
  - Extend the story cards with some of these points as a reminder
