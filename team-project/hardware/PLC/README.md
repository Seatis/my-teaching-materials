# TOTORO PLC

## Description

A PLC-like system with PLC structure. The Master(CPU) unit a STM32F746G-DISCO board, the slaves are NUCLEO-L476RG. The Slaves are the I/O-s, the master is the brain. One teams work on this project.

The main goals are to:
- Create a working system with the most used IO-s
- Choose and design proper backbus communication, task handling
- SQL data upload
- Use a real PLC at the end

## Main features
