# Module 04: Day 2 - Objects & Classes : Continuing
Having introduced the OO construct, we go deeper to better master such.  We revisit setting the means to access and set properties (Setters & Getters).  We also return to constructors and consider how the data is stored and accessd.

Having now understood objects, we consider the generic object type and how we convert between primitive and objects; boxing and unboxing.  

Lastly, we learn about threads giving us some experience using implementing interface.

## Assignment Review


## Topics


### Object datatype
- Concepts: 
  - utility - what are the benefits
  - what does it know (underlying datatype)
  - is a pointer
  - primitive vs complex datatypes
- boxing and unboxing  

### Getters &amp; Setters
- IntelliJ tool
- References to the same data (outside of the class)


### Boxing &amp; Unboxing / Conversion
- Conversion from simple to object type


### Threads

## Workshop/Practice 

### Challenge 
Ideas
- Create base class
- Do something where one needs to use this.
- Something needing to play with super()
- Override a method
- 2 types of constructors
- Implement an Abstract class
- static
