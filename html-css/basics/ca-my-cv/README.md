# Cognitive Apprenticeship: My CV
*Watch and learn as your mentor live-codes their own CV on the projector*

Pay attention how your mentor:
- starts a project, creates folder structure, sets up git
- starts with the content, uses placeholder texts and images
- commits frequently, with informative commit messages
- breaks down the content to semantic elements
- applies styling: from text styles to layout to special cases
- goes back and forth from html to css to browser
