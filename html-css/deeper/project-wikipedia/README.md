# Project: Wikipedia article
Build the [Margaret Hamilton Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist))

## How to get started
- Start by examining the page, figure out the biggest components
- Create a box for the Header, Main content, Sidebar and Footer
- Try to resize the browser window: Your version should resize and work the same way as the original (Except the resize of the sidebar, it can remain the same size)
- Figure out the component blocks in the Header, Main content, Sidebar and Footer, like: Logo, Navigations, Search bar, Infobox in the content, Footer links
- Create boxes for these as well and roughly do the positioning
- Fill these components with the right content
- Start to style these components (main colors, backgrounds, typography, paddings, borders and margins first)
