# Pointers
*Learn how to use pointers in C programs*

## Objectives
- Know how to use pointers in C language
- Understand how functions and pointers work together

## Materials & Resources
### Environment
  - Make sure that Code::Blocks is installed on your machine

### Training
#### C programming language
##### Pointers
This topic usually blows every C newbie's mind. The pointers are quite confusing
but they are very useful tools in C.

## Material Review
### C programming language

### Pointers
- memory address
- how does variables stored in memory
- the `sizeof` function
- pointer syntax `*`, `&`
- dereferencing
- arrays and pointers
- pass by
  - reference
  - value
  - when to use them
- arrays and functions
  - pointer and size
  - separate parameter for array size
  - can't return both at the same time

### Functions and pointers
- array as pointer
- output parameters
- returning pointer

## Individual Workshop Review
Please follow the styleguide: [Our C styleguide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/styleguide/c.md)

 - Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
 - Are the includes placed on the top of the files?
 - Is the indentation good in each file?
 - Is there unnecessary code?
 - Can you find unnecessary code in comments?
 - Is there unnecessary code duplication?
 - Are there unnecessary empty blocks?
 - Can you spot unused variables?
 - Is the commit message meaningful?
