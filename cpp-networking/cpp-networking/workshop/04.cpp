// Rewrite Your amoeba app so, that Your network implementations 
// actually implement the abstract classes You defined in the previous
// exercise. Use these to enabe communication between two client applications
// through a separate server application.
//
// Basically rewrite Your amoeba app to be a neworked multiplayer game.
//
// If You start the application with the modifier: '-c' You should be able from the console like before.
// If You start the application with the modifier: '-n <IP-Address> <player-id>' You should be able toÂ¤
// play with someone over the network. Connecting to a server at <ip-adderss> and connecting to the
// nearest avalable <player-id> that hasn't been paired yet. Basically just pair everyone with the next
// player that connects to the server.
