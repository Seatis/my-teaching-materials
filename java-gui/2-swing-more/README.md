# Java Swing Listener/Event Handling

Having looked at how data is displayed, in this unit we look at how the events are communicated back to the program.  This leverages both the JFrames we learnt earlier and Interfaces.  Her, you'll now see how you (as a programmer) hook into the Java engine to tell it what to call if an event happens.  You'll be registering your code to be called by the Interface implemented.

Also, in this unit we set up for the Demo Project for the week.
