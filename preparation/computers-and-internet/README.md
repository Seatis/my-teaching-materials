# Week 1: Computers and the Internet

How the computer actually works is important to understand at the fundamental level. We will also look at how multiple computers can communicate and form a network we know as the internet. 

## Self assessment

Don't forget to open the personal wiki spreadhseet and explain the concepts for this given time period. 

## Monday: Computer basics

Your laptop and phone are the result of a rapid evolution, but they still use these very same concepts.
