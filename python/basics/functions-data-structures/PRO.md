## Programming problems

### Linear Search

Implement linear search method.

```python
linear_search([4,5,6], 6)
# expected output: 2

linear_search([4,5,7], 6)
# expected output: -1
```

### Union method

Implement union method which combines two arrays.

```python
union([4,5,6], [1,2,3])
# expected output: [4,5,6,1,2,3]

union([4,5,7], [4,1,7])
# expected output: [1,4,5,7]
```

### Sort

Implement bubble sort method.

```python
bubble_sort([3,9,4,5,2,1])
# expected output: [1,2,3,4,5,9]
```

### Binary search method

Implement binary search, wich tests if the param is sorted, sorts if not and search for the other param.

```python
binary_search([4,5,6], 6)
# expected output: true

binary_search([4,5,7], 6)
# expected output: false
```
