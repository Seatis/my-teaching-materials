# Spring
As Java development grows in size so to, it will grow in complexity as the developers deal with many more classes.  While learning, you work with but a handful of classes, a typical development can involve hundreds if not thousands.

Spring is one of the leading, Java development framework that takes over many of the repetitive and book-keeping tasks.  In this way the code base is more maintainable while remaining polymorphic.  Spring is not small.  It covers a wide range of aspects in programming and we'll only scratch the surface.  However, given it's prominence in the Java development community, today's Java IT graduates are expected to be somewhat acquainted.

Over the next 2 weeks we'll get to know Spring better and also, a couple of other key aspects of Java.

##Week 09 - Bean Basics
This week is organised around a project, *Calorie Counter*.  There will be fewer daily tasks each day, just doing simple exercises to become acquainted with the technology.  The remainder will be apply such to the web app that we will be building up.
