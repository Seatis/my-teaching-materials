#Workshop02 - Swapping Services through Beans

To get this to work, when you start the project you need to be sure that you've informed IntelliJ that you're working with Spring.  Same as last time, but this time you need at least 1 library.

If you didn't select a particular library, there's help here.  https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/enabling-spring-support.html#addFacet

For this exercise, construct the code described in this worked example. http://www.journaldev.com/2410/spring-dependency-injection.  

Test it, get familiar and then answer the following questions:-
- what does ComponentScan do?
- how does Autowired know what to pick up?
- how would one switch the service to do Twitter instead?
- what happens when you rename a Bean?
- Drawing out the way that one class calls the other with the annotation used to call upon the other.
