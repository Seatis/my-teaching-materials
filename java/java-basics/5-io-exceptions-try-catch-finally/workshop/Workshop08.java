 * Workshop: Practice Exceptions: Having raised exceptions, then what?  I'm looking to get some 
 * closure here.  "Finally" would do... whatever else, this is what I need if something goes 
 * wrong...
 *
 *
 * 
 * So, I'm looking for the following output:
 * try - first statement
 * start - myMethod
 * An Exception Occurred
 * Finally I did this instead
 * ::::FINISH LINE:::: out of the try/catch/finally statement
 *

public class Workshop08{

   static void myMethod(int inNumber) throws Exception// something should appear here before (see Workshop07)

   public static void main(String  args[]) // see Workshop07
   
}
