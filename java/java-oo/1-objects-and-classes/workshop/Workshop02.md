This is a fuller spec.  You can do this in the same Project, but this is now a new class and should be tested with Workshop02.

#Create a `Circle` class:

+ Constructor
  - Given a parameter, sets the radius
  - No parameter passed, radius of 1
+ Methods
  - `getPerimeter` - turns the circumference.
  - `getArea` - returns it's area.
  - `countObjects` - returns the number of circles


#Tests
- Create a standard circle with no radius
  -- what's its perimeter and area
- Create a user defined circle
  -- what's its perimeter and area
