# The Second test experience
- Create a sum method in your class which has an ArrayList of Integers as parameter
- It should return the sum of the elements in the list
- Create a test for that
    - Add a new test method
    - Instantiate your class
    - create a list of integers
    - use the `assertEquals` to test the result of the created sum method
- Run them
- Create different tests where you
    - test your method with an empyt list
    - with a list with one element in it
    - with multiple elements in it
    - with a `null`
- Run them
- Fix your code if needed
