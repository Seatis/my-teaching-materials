TOTORO Chat
====================
Commands:
 -e   explore the network
 -n   enter your name
 -q   quit
 -p   private message

 ```

### Explore the network
 - Explore the network, than you need to store the address of the members
 - If there is somebody it should look like this:


 ```
Avaiable partners:
168.15.18.1
178.89.55.54
```

### Send message
 - After you know the partners available, send a message to all of them, and if they respond write it out. BOOM a chat app:)


  ```
 You:  I'am the first
 168.15.18.1  hello there
 178.89.55.54 csa
 ```

### User frendly
 - Make your app user friendly by structuring the messages and get the name instead of ip addresses printed out.


 ```
Avaiable partners: 2

168.15.18.1   Kazy
178.89.55.54  Zsolti
====================
You:    I'am the first
Kazy:   hello there
Zsolti: csa
```

### Make it personal
 - Explore the network, than you need to store the address of the members with name
 - By entering for example `-p kazy` you ???open??? private chat
