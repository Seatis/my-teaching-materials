## Workshop
This is a quite long project, at first read the specification. Try to figure out
what kind of data storing technique (for example structure, array etc.) would fit
for this project. Try to make a concept in your head about how you will implement the
application.

### Basics (mandatory) tasks
You create an app hat explore the network and find the totoro chat partners, than you can write to the avaiable members. So:

- [Explore the network](#Explore_the_network)
- [Send message](#send_message)
- [User friendly](#user_frendly)

### Advanced tasks
- [make it personal](#make_it_personal)


```
TOTORO Chat
====================
Commands:
 -e   explore the network
 -n   enter your name
 -q   quit
 -p   private message

 ```

### Explore the network
 - Explore the network, than you need to store the address of the members
 - If there is somebody it should look like this:


 ```
Avaiable partners:
168.15.18.1
178.89.55.54
```

### Send message
 - After you know the partners available, send a message to all of them, and if they respond write it out. BOOM a chat app:)


  ```
 You:  I'am the first
 168.15.18.1  hello there
 178.89.55.54 csa
 ```

### User frendly
 - Make your app user friendly by structuring the messages and get the name instead of ip addresses printed out.


 ```
Avaiable partners: 2

168.15.18.1   Kazy
178.89.55.54  Zsolti
====================
You:    I'am the first
Kazy:   hello there
Zsolti: csa
```

### Make it personal
 - Explore the network, than you need to store the address of the members with name
 - By entering for example `-p kazy` you ???open??? private chat
