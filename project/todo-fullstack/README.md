# Fullstack TODO application

![Todo mockup](todo-mockup.png)

Everything you've learnt during the Javascript-orientation period can be practiced with this fullstack exercise to deepen your knowledge.

## The project

Create a fullstack todo application with database with the aim to get, store todos in a database. 

The user should have the access to her/his data, manipulate it by updating or deleting it.

As a general advice, don't spend too much time with the UI, rather concentrate on the functionality. 

The main focus should be to practice the client-server communication, sending and receiving proper http requests and building/handling database. In addition, writing tests where they are really needed.
