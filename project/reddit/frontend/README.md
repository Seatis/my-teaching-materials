# The Reddit: Frontend

We'll create a simple reddit clone frontend, where the users can create posts,
upvote and downvote existing posts. Later on you can extend this with more
functionality.

Read the [Reddit Application API documentation](../apispec.md) and you can also
check out [the final version](assets/views/final.png?raw=true). Store the API's
URL in a global variable because you'll have to change it.

## Assets

 -  [arrow images](assets/arrows)

## Mandatory features

### List the posts

Create the HTML structure and the design of
[the main page](assets/views/main_00.png?raw=true) using static data. Remove the
static data and fill the page with posts using the API.

#### Notes

 -  no other functionality should be added yet
 -  it's okay to display the elapsed time only in minutes
 -  if the post has no owner it's posted by anonymous
 -  numbering does not need to be in order by score

### Add post

Create the HTML structure and the design of
[the add post page](assets/views/add.png?raw=true). Add the functionality. Add
that nice top navigation bar to
[the main page](assets/views/main_01.png?raw=true).

#### Notes

 -  since you have no user handling yet post as anonymous is always on
 -  do not let the user post with empty fields
 -  redirection to the main page after a successful addition would be nice to
    have
 -  use your creativity and replace the page text
 -  that link above will show you a modified main page, make sure to check it

### Vote

Modify [the main page](assets/views/main_02.png?raw=true) so that those arrows
can finally do something useful using the API.

#### Notes

 -  the score should be updated
 -  the color should change


## Find a Backend partner

 -  At this point go to the Slack channel #reddit
 -  Find someone who is developing the backend part
 -  Make sure that you're on the A66 Guest network
 -  Get your partner's local IP address, and change the API's URL
 -  Test out each other's work

## Optional features

### Remove

Modify [the main page](assets/views/main_03.png?raw=true) so it is possible to
remove a post using the API.

#### Notes

 -  anonymous posts can be removed by anyone
 -  a post with owner can be only removed by the owner
 -  if you have no rights to remove that post it should remain grey.
 -  but since it's not mandatory to handle the user you might just enable the
    remove feature for every post

### Modify

Create the HTML structure and the design of
[the modify post page](assets/views/modify.png?raw=true). Add the functionality.
Modify your main page so it is possible the modify a post.

#### Notes

 -  use query parameters for identifying the post
 -  check out what [location.search](http://bfy.tw/BjIf) is
 -  fields should be prefilled with the proper data

### Login

Create the HTML structure and the design of
[the login page](assets/views/login.png?raw=true). Add the functionality. Add
login link to your navigation bar and modify every request so it uses the
username.

#### Notes

 -  no authentication is required
 -  check out what [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is
 -  if username is set it should display **LOGGED IN AS `<username>`** otherwise
    **LOGIN Â»**

### Order by score

Modify the main page so the numbering is ordered by the scores.
