## Coding Rules

With the exceptions listed below, we follow the rules contained in
[Google's Markdown Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md):

 -  **Lists**: Use `-` as bullets instead of `*`
 -  **Nested list spacing**: Use a single space before a bullet or a numbered list
    ```markdown
     1. 1 spaces after a numbered list.
        4 space indent for wrapped text.
     2. 1 spaces again.

     -  2 spaces after a bullet.
        4 space indent for wrapped text.
         1. 1 spaces after a numbered list.
            8 space indent for the wrapped text of a nested list.
         2. Looks nice, don't it?
     -  3 spaces after a bullet.
    ```
