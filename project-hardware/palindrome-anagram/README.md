# Project Exercises
## Hardware specific info
During the [last workshop](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/tree/master/workshop/hardware/arrays-pointers-input-UART) you wrote C code which made the ATmega168PB capable of
using stdio.h functions.

Use that code as a template for this project!

Your task is to do the exercises on the ATmega168PB MCU. To send and receive strings
use the UART (serial port) interface. On your PC use the [RealTerm](https://realterm.sourceforge.io/) application.
