## Additional informations about the fedex day that you might have missed:
- Can I work on my normal project? ---> Yes. But it could be useful to form a team and creat something great together.
- Can I prepare for the Orientation Exam? ---> Yes. But sometimes it is better to use your imagination and work on something else.
- Can I prepare for the Fedex Day? ---> Yes.

Overall, Fedex Day is an event, where you can creat cool stuffs by the knowledge you have earned already. So the purpose of this
project page is to help you find out what you want to do and how to do it. We recommend you to use the STM32F7 board, it is a great way
to imporve your existing skills, while you can learn new things as well. We also recommend you to work in project groups,
it is useful to improve your teamworking skills and you can also learn a lot form your teammates.

### Quick overview about the things we have already done:
- LED blinker
- Pushbutton handling
- UART on STM32
- Basic LCD usage
- USB HID (human interface device)
- [Closed loop control on STM32](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/project/hardware/fedex/pwm-timer-ADC.md):
    - pwm
    - timer
    - ADC
- [The lwIP library with RTOS](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/project/hardware/fedex/cmsis-rtos.md):
    - lwIP Socket API
    - CMSIS - RTOS functions

#### Recipe for a great project:
- a team, we recommend you to work with your classmates, so you can help each other, you can work
on a greater project (you can manage multiple tasks)
- start with a brainstorming, listen to each other, and also you can mix the ideas to one unstoppable project
- use previous workshop and project pages
- create a block diagram, design the working method of the program
- deal out the tasks, everyone should do something, always talk over your ideas and issues with your team
- infinite amount of coffee and pizza (luckily coffee is provided)

You have to understand the example codes with time and experience you will get better and better. If there is a procejt from the past weeks what you haven't finished look up the solutions try to reproduce them. Talk through codes with your classmates. **Last but not least: have fun!**
