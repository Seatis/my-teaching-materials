Create a `Pirate` class.  While you can add other fields and methods, you must have these methods:-
+ `drinkSomeRum()` - intoxicates the Pirate some
+ `howsItGoingMate()` - when called, the Pirate replies, if `drinkSomeRun` was called:-
  - 0 to 4 times, "Pour me anudder!"
  - else, "Arghh, I'ma Pirate. How d'ya d'ink its goin?", the pirate passes out and sleeps it off.

If you manage to get this far, then you can try to do the following.
+ `die()` - this kills off the pirate, in which case, drinkSomeRum, etc. just result in `he's dead`.
+ `brawl(x)` - where pirate fights another pirate (if that other pirate is alive) and there's a 1/3 chance, 1 dies, the other dies or they both pass out.  

Note for brawl, you'll need `this`, and you'll probably want to use the ArrayList to get yourself a couple of pirates friends to play with.

And... if you get that far...

Add a parrot.
