# Objects and Classes
Classes and Objects lay at the heart of Java.  Until this point we have had to cover the foundation of programming (variables, conditionals, simple I/O and loops) as well as some core skills (getting a program to run and watching it execute so as to debug).  Now that we have that foundation laid, we can turn our attention to a core element of the Java: Object Orientation (aka "OO").  In the late 80s, this was the &quot;Promised Land&quot; (that&apos;s a biblical metaphor for *the future of programming*).  

With OO, a new realm of programming opened up.  It became easier to deliver more complex problems as they could be broken down into simpler units.  OO removed complexity and ensured a common understanding leading to standards that in turn has allowed us to develop bigger (and distributed) systems.

In this segment we'll first cover theory (and how it arose); then go through a series of videos (by Bana) that show how Java provides these features.
