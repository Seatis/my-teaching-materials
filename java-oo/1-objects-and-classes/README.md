# Module 3 - #01 - Introduction to Classes and Objects
Classes and Objects lay at the heart of Java.  Until this point we have covered the foundations of programming (that is variables, conditionals, simple I/O and loops) as well as learning some core skills (getting a program to run and watching it execute so as to debug).  

Now that we have a foundation, we can turn our attention to a core element of the Java *Object Orientation* (aka "OO").  In the late 80s, this was the &quot;Promised Land&quot; (that&apos;s a biblical metaphor for *the future of programming*).  

With OO, a new realm of programming opened up.  It became easier to deliver more complex problems as they could be broken down into simpler units.  OO removed complexity and ensured a common understanding leading to standards that in turn has allowed one to develop more complex and distributed systems.

In this segment we'll first cover the theory (and how it arose); then go through a series of videos that show how Java provides these features and build your vocabulary and knowledge base.
