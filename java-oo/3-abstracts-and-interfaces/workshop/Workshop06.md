#Workshop06 - Comparator/Comparable Practice
Knowing about the comparator and comparable approach, return to the earlier Workshop04 and add the following sorting features:-
- Able to sort by reservation number, ascending and descending
- Able to sort by credit card number, ascending and descending
- Able to sort by Dow (Day of week), this will require some additional tinkering...
  - in the comparison the text string MON (or TUE, WED ... etc) will have to be converted to a number
  - MON is the start of the week
  - as with the other situations, do ascending and descending.
