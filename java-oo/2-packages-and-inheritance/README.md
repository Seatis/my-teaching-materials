# Module 04 #1 Packages &amp; Inheritance

Input/Output (aka I/O)
If anything can go wrong, it will.   Programming is not exempt and exceptions come in all sorts of ways:-
- the data entered or received is of a type that isn't expected
- the location for data is wrong
- an unexpected event or condition occurs.

We don't always anticipate every situation, and machines (like people) don't always behave as anticipated.

Fortunately, we have ways to handle errors.  One is to code defensively.  That is, ensure the error cannot occur by inserting code that  checks the data that the program is about to handle.  Another is to code in fallbacks.  These say, *if something goes wrong, do this to recover*.

I/O (which standards for Input/Output) addresses how we work with *streams* of data.  Data might be streamed from a source (like YouTube), the disk drive; perhaps a device monitoring items on a conveyor belt.  

And we have combined these topics here as I/O is one place where you cannot always predict what might be happen and therefore must be ready for Exceptions.  

## Objectives
 - What are the Exceptions and how to handle them using try-catch-finally.
 - How to write and read a text file from java.
