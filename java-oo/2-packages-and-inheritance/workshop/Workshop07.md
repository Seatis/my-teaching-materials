Create a `Cylinder` class which inherits from `Circle`.

It should have the followings:
  - a height field with getters/setters
  - a constructor with `height` parameters (in this case the radius and color have to be the default)
  - a constructor with `radius` and `height` as parameters
  - a constructor with `radius`, `height` and `color` as parameters
  - a function which computes the volume of the cylinder, the function name should be `getVolume()`

Hint: use `super()` where you can.
